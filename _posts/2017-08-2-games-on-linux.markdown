What is the point?

I would like to say that I am not a serious gamer. I do have a dedicated machine that I can use for games if I so desire. This computer is running Windows, and is currently being employed to prevent dust from gathering in it's particular location on the desk. So why, as someone that uses Linux every day, don't I just install Linux on it and play some games that are supported by Linux?

The first thing I question is price: Steam games, the ones generally in question, are not free. Linux can be obtained and installed for free, yet Windows, on the other hand, has something in common with Steam games, and that is that you

should for it. Personally, I would rather pay for my OS, and get games for free, but that's my personal preference.

The next thing I would like to introduce to the argument is the support. I know that Nvidia supports Linux to a degree, but with updating the kernel and the shift to Wayland for many distros, it has it's challenges. It seems that these need to be addressed each time there is an update. Sometimes you can't play games when you want because it just isn't working, and then you have to be a sysadmin to get it all running again. With Windows, on the other hand, heaven forbid that Nvidia drivers don't work when you go to play a game!

So I have an Nvidia card. Do I "buy another GPU" in order for my Linux machine to play games. Well, if I were running Windows, I just use this GPU, so in that case my free Linux OS would be costing me even more money! At this stage, the argument shifts to "Linux is too expensive to play games on!"

Last of all, my opinion is that Linux has it's strengths, and that it does most jobs very well. Most think about Linux as being for servers (if anything; such is the ignorance of the world), but from my own personal experience, it is also good for development. Windows doesn't perform these jobs with as much simplicity as Linux. I personally believe that Windows is the platform of choice for games.

I understand that some individuals will disagree with these thoughts and opinions.

I like Linux games, especially the open source and community developed games that are specifically designed for Linux. I simply decide not to spend money on buying hardware that specifically runs on Linux, then buying games that specifically work on Linux; it is just way too expensive in comparison, especially if you "get it wrong".

At the end of the day, it doesn't make too much sense to me to buy rights to play games on a free OS. I think it would be a small step to purchase a licence to run Windows.

But then again...

...I'm not a great gamer.
