We need to talk about this.

First of all, I would like to say that I am not a gamer, and that I have a machine separate form my work here in the office that I can use for games if I so require. The computer is running Windows, and is generally sitting around gathering dust. So why, as someone that loves Linux, don't I just install Linux on it and play some games that are supported by Linux?

The first thing I want to question is price: Steam games, the ones generally in question, are not free. Linux can be obtained and installed for free, yet Windows, on the other hand, has something in common with Steam games, and that is that you generally have to pay for them. Personally, I would rather pay for my OS, and get games for free, but that's my personal preference.

The next thing I would like to bring to light is the support. I know that Nvidia supports Linux to a degree, but with updating the kernel and the shift to Wayland for many distros has it's challenges. It seems that these need to be addressed each time there is an update, and once again, you can't play games when you want, you have to be a sysadmin to get it all running again. Windows, however, heaven forbid that Nvidia drivers don't work!

An argument to this latter point could be "buy another GPU". Well, if I were running Windows, I just use this GPU, so in that case my free Linux OS is now costing me more money.

Last of all, my thoughts tell me that Linux has it's strengths that is does very well. We think about Linux as being for server, but my own personal experience is that it is also good for development. Windows doesn't fit into either of these categories as well as Linux, but Windows is the platform of choice for games. So Windows is a gaming operating system in my mind.

If I was to buy games, whether I have a Mac or Linux machine, I would be better off also buying a licence to run Windows, which I might also get for a good price.
