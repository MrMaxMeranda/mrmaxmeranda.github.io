Google is wonderful when you are having a bit of a bother trying to make your Raspberry Pi do the right thing. You just Google the problem, as best as you can describe it, and Google will display thousands, if not millions of results to help you out. Stack overflow, blogs, forums, etc. will come up in the results giving you the power to achieve what you have set out to try and accomplish!

Or is it power?

My brief list of problems with doing this is:

<ul>
  <li>Blogs are invariably out of date</li>
  <li>The person writing the blog post also Googled what you are asking, and came up with a list of things which he too has no idea about, but wanted to write a post for ad revenue.</li>
  <li>The list of things to do is so great, and you go through step by step, some hours are spent just for the problem to still exist.</li>
  <li>Because you have no idea what you are doing and are faithfully flying blind, is this operation suggested to you <em>safe</em>?</li>
  <li>Refinding which blog post, forum thread, and Stack Overflow question you found in the first place to make that "thing" work.</li>
</ul>

So my question is, "Do you really have power with Google?"

I know that there are a number of people out there that have some (sometimes) brilliant articles to help you to understand some concepts, and ideas behind how Nginx (which which pronounced "engine-x", by the way) works, and how to secure it for production. There are some great articles, and many blogs are competing for educational supremacy.

There is only one small problem I have with this: Sometimes they <strong>don't</strong> answer the question that you have been asking all along:

<ul>
	<li>Is this out of date?</li>
	<li>Will I understand this?</li>
	<li>Will this work for me?</li>
	<li>Is this safe?</li>
	<li>Will I remember this?</li>
</ul>

So I am just creating problems that you didn't even know were existing!

The real question is, "Are you trying to 'learn you computer'", or are you just trying to get by? Things that I wish to show you on this website are all about trying to help you to learn and how to get the best information.

The best thing about Linux is that you have access to 'man' pages.

Projects such as PHP, Apache, Docker, and Python have project pages that have--shock horror--exhaustive documentation.

Payed courses are the achilles of learning. I've done several payed and free courses that are made by freelancers, and I have to admit, the amount that I have learnt from these and use now is very limited. I once did a photography course, and was able to use the skills that I was taught at a paying job. Also, tips and help in graphic design was also very helpful, and also came in handy when doing paid work. Ultimately, what I did learn I learnt not by the one-two-three-follow-me technique that most courses offer, but by trying things out for myself. With photography, I was told to go out and try adjusting this setting, or using that area for this effect. With something like learning you computer, it's about, "This does that, does that, now moving on, we have lots to cover in a few minutes." 

YouTube videos, which have been free till in recent years, have been very motivational and informative.

Blog posts are a quick way to get information on whether something is possible or not.

Stack overflow and Bugzilla are useful to know if something is a bug or a feature.
