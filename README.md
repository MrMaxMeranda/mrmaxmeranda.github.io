Lair of MrMaxMeranda

This site is a work in progress at the present.

Lair of MrMaxMeranda is the personal home of MrMaxMeranda, an Australian Linux computer enthusiast.

The purpose of this site is to share the knowledge that I have acquired over the years of administering Linux computers and also to share my learning experiences.
